# How Can I Contribute?

There are lots of ways to get involved. Here are some suggestions of things we'd love some help with. 

## Resolving existing issues 

You can consider helping out with issues already requiring attention - look for a "help wanted" label. 

## Reporting issues 

If you run into problems in the project, you can report them by opening a new issue and providing as much context as you can about what you're running into, along with a failing code sample to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue. 

> **Note:** Before filing an issue, please check both open and closed issues to see if the problem has already been reported.

## Documentation

We are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.
